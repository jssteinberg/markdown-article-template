# Pretty and readable plain-text markdown articles

A proposal for how to format markdown articles (e.g. blog posts) so they're readable in their plain-text form **and** can output the necessary meta data without e.g. YAML front matter. This expands upon [markdown's original concept of readable plain-text files](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy).


```markdown
# Title

Nicely formatted markdown articles---nice and readable in their plain-text form.

Valid, normal markdown.

```

Meta data is added without YAML front matter (YFM) in a more markdowny way. It's reminiscent of YFM, but simpler and it's valid markdown. It looks and feels as a more natural part of markdown.

**The goal** is a markdown file-template for complete articles, including meta data, that is as readable as possible in plain-text and when it's rendered without specific HTML/CSS (for instance at Github). And with a possible (Javascript, JSON, Graphql, ...) output that is fully usable in an application of any kind.


## Background

The problems with YAML front matter (and another front matter in another language):

1. YFM isn't markdown and not a natural part of plain-text markdown.
2. When markdown is converted to HTML in a generic context, YFM is at best output as a table at the top of the article (at Github for instance). In these general contexts YFM can lead to ugly, less readable HTML, or HTML errors.


## Markdown Template Proposal

```markdown
# Title

A lead paragraph.

The content body in normal markdown.

---
Optional Author Name,
Several Names Separated By Comma
* unordered list item: meta data
* key: single value
* comma separated: array, of, values
* no value---true boolean,
```

The article ends with an horizontal rule immediately followed by the additional (meta) data.

The meta data (which is in the unordered list below the horizontal rule) only support strings and arrays containing the former. The language in question must cast to other types if needed.


## Output

JSON output:

```json
{
  "title": "Title",
  "lead": "A lead paragraph.",
  "body": "<p>The content body in normal markdown.</p>",
  "by": ["Optional Author Name", "Several Names Separated By Comma"],
  "unordered list item": "meta data",
  "key": "single value",
  "comma_separated": ["array", "of", "values"],
  "no_value---true_boolean": "true"
}
```


## The Subtitle Option

```markdown
# Title: Subtitle

A lead paragraph.

The content body in normal markdown.

---
Optional Author Name,
Several Names Separated By Comma
* unordered list item: meta data
* key: single value
* comma separated: array, of, values
* no value---true boolean,
```


## The Abstract Option

An option to treat all markdown elements after the lead paragraph and before the first horizontal rule as the abstract.

```markdown
# Title: Subtitle

A lead paragraph.

An abstract consisting of any markdown elements.

---

The content body in normal markdown.

---
Optional Author Name,
Several Names Separated By Comma
* unordered list item: meta data
* key: single value
* comma separated: array, of, values
* no value---true boolean,
```


## Simple implementation

*Under construction! At the moment [Sapper](https://github.com/jssteinberg/sapper-floor-template) is used to test the implementation.*

See [src/utils/](https://github.com/jssteinberg/markdown-article-template/tree/main/src/utils) for a simple Javascript implementation using the marked library and regex of both markdown and HTML strings to create the output for an API. (A finer implementation should probably use remark/rehype...)

Boolean and numbers are both output as strings.

A collection of articles is by default sorted by title, then overridden by `sortBy`. So if any articles are missing a sortBy property they are moved to the end in order by title.

`sortBy`:

- `type`: a string of [Javascript type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures) (it can be lowercase)

```javascript
// How to use utils!
// `opt` parameter
const opt = {
	markedSetOptions: {
		smartLists: true,
		smartypants: true,
		highlight: function(code, lang) {
			return hljs.highlight(code, {language: lang}).value;
		}
	},
	sortBy: {
		property: ['edited', 'redigert'],
		type: 'date',
		index: -1,
	},
	// longOutput: true,
};
```
